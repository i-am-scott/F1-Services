### Formula 1 Discord Bot

A simple bot for getting Formula 1 information for my Discord community.
Uses a combonation of the ErgastF1 and live data from the Formula 1 website.

Currently need to cache all Ergast API info to redis.
Heavily WIP and only does what I needed. Feel free to take for whatever you want.

This requires Redis for sending and receiveing data from the F1LiveTelemetry solution for live race messages.
